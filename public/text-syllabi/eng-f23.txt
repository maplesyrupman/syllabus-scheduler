I. COURSE INFORMATION

COURSE DESCRIPTION
An introduction to literature written by men and women from a variety of countries. This
course will include literature up to the year 1660.

N.B. It is vital that you read the works before you hear the lectures on them!

LEARNING OUTCOMES
      By the end of the course, students must demonstrate in their writing and classroom
      discussion:
•     An understanding of the characteristic form and content of various genres of literature, e.g.
      epic, tragedy, romance, lyric poetry and connect them to their religious worldviews.
•     An understanding of how literary allusion is used, and how literal and figurative meaning
      interplay.
•     An ability to integrate the material they learn with the concurrent historical and
      philosophical developments.
•     The beginning of a capacity to reflect on the religious presuppositions of every age,
      including our own.
